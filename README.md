# cnp-java-base

## Purpose
Base docker image for Java Spring Boot applications running in containers, specifically on Kubernetes.

## Latest version:
https://hub.docker.com/r/hmcts/cnp-java-base/tags/

## Features

It uses the new JVM container-aware settings introduced in Java 10 and backported to Java 8 in release 191. For more information see:
[Java 8u191 release notes](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u191-relnotes-5032181.html#JDK-8146115).

The image includes base settings tuned to provide best trade off between speed and memory efficiency. 

For documentation for (previous) versions, openjdk-8u181-jre-alpine3.8-1.0  and openjdk-jre-8-slim-stretch-1.0, see:
[Openjdk 8 181 base image docs](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-java-base/tree/openjdk-8u181-jre-alpine3.8-1.0) 

Application insights agent is bundled (check APP_INSIGHTS_AGENT_VERSION for the current version, this can be customised), and loaded at runtime for you with the `-agentlib` JVM option.

## Usage
To use this as your base image, construct your Dockerfile like so:
```
FROM hmcts/cnp-java-base:<get the latest tag from https://hub.docker.com/r/hmcts/cnp-java-base/tags/>

# Note: replace with your app name.
COPY build/libs/cnp-rhubarb-recipes-service.jar /opt/app/

CMD ["cnp-rhubarb-recipes-service.jar"]
```

Advanced version:
```
ARG JAVA_OPTS="" # Optional, do not include if unneeded
ARG APP_INSIGHTS_AGENT_VERSION=2.3.2 #Â get a different version of the app insights agent jar

FROM hmcts/cnp-java-base:<get the latest tag from https://hub.docker.com/r/hmcts/cnp-java-base/tags/>

# Note: replace with your app name.
COPY build/libs/cnp-rhubarb-recipes-service.jar /opt/app/

CMD ["cnp-rhubarb-recipes-service.jar"]
# Alternatively you can also pass options to your applications
# CMD ["cnp-rhubarb-recipes-service.jar", "--option1", ...]
```

Notes:
* DO NOT attempt to override any of the JVM tuning options specified in the base Dockerfile (e.g. `-Xmx`) unless you really
know what you are doing.

## Building
You can use the Makefile to build locally.  If you need to make a change, remember to tag it for the Dockerhub automated build.  For example:
```
git tag openjdk-8u191-jre-alpine3.9-1.0
git push --tags
```
